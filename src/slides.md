## Quickstrom

- Autonomous browser testing
- Test anything that renders to the DOM
- You write specifications
- Quickstrom explores your application and finds invalid behaviors

## Today's Agenda

- Background
- The TodoMVC Showdown
- Specification Language
- Checking Webapps
- Future Work
- Q&A

# Background

## Web development

- Always an interest of mine
- Huge area and market
- Browser testing is mainly example/scenario based

## Property-Based Testing

- Last few years
    - Blog posts
    - Book: "Property-Based Testing in a Screencast Editor"
- State machine testing for UIs
    - Lots of work
    - Boilerplate
    - Requires a full model

## Formal Methods

- F*
- TLA+
- Temporal logics

## Quickstrom

- Idea: mix these together
    - Use linear temporal logic (LTL) and learnings from formal methods
    - Use it for browser testing
    - Leverage the DOM and introspective capabilities
    - Run as property-based tests
- Benefits (on top of PBT):
    - Focus on specifying and understanding
    - No more `sleep` or `wait`
    - Safety properties can be "weak"

## How It Works

1. Navigate to *origin page*
2. Record a trace (sequence of states and actions)
    1. Generate random actions
    2. Pick one *possible* action and perform it
    3. Record state
    4. Go to 1
3. Check that the behavior (only the states) satisfies the
   specification
4. If rejected, shrink sequence of actions

# The TodoMVC Showdown

## Early benchmark: TodoMVC

- Use TodoMVC as a test for Quickstrom
- Wrote a single spec (for new and legacy formats)
- Checked mainstream implementations
- Found issues in Angular and Mithril implementations
- Submitted a [GitHub
  issue](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/issues/2116) with findings

## The TodoMVC Showdown

- Improved the specification
- Checked all implementations
- Results:
  - 37 passed
  - 12 failed
  - 4 not testable
- Wrote a [blog
  post](https://wickstrom.tech/programming/2020/07/02/the-todomvc-showdown-testing-with-webcheck.html)
  detailing the results

# Specification Language

## Specification Language

- Based on PureScript
- Extended with:
    - Linear temporal logic operators 
      - [De Giacomo, Giuseppe & Vardi, Moshe. (2013). Linear temporal logic and Linear Dynamic Logic on finite traces. IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence. 854-860.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285919325_Linear_temporal_logic_and_Linear_Dynamic_Logic_on_finite_traces)
    - DOM queries
- Use regular PureScript packages
- Interpreter built in Haskell

## Temporal Operators

- Change the modality of the sub-expression
- Available operators from LTL:
    ```haskell
    next :: forall a. a -> a
    always :: Boolean -> Boolean
    until :: Boolean -> Boolean -> Boolean
    ```

## DOM Queries

- Two operators:
  - `queryOne`
  - `queryAll`
- Take as arguments:
  1. CSS selector
  2. Record of _element state specifiers_
- Examples:
    
    ```haskell
    queryAll "button" { textContent, disabled }
        :: Array { textContent :: String, disabled :: Bool }

    queryOne "input" { value }
        :: Maybe { value :: String }
    ```

## Actions

- We must instruct Quickstrom which actions to try
- List of weighted probabilities and action specifiers

    ```
    Array (Tuple Int Action)
    ```

- Comes with predefined actions, e.g.:

    ```haskell
    -- | Generate focus actions on common focusable elements.
    foci :: Actions
    foci = [ Tuple 1 (Focus "input"), Tuple 1 (Focus "textarea") ]
    ```

- Often need to carefully pick selectors, actions, and weights

## Haskell Interpreter

- Some supported PureScript packages:
  - `numbers`
  - `strings`
  - `arrays`
  - `transformers`
  - `generics-rep`
  - ...
- FFI is implemented in Haskell
    - Packages' foreign functions are built into Quickstrom

# Checking Webapps

## Running Tests

- Use the `check` command:

    ```sh
    quickstrom check \
        /path/to/my/specification \
        http://example.com
    ```

- Origin can be a file:

    ```sh
    quickstrom check \
        /path/to/my/specification \
        /path/to/my/webapp.html
    ```

- Requires a WebDriver server

## Cross-Browser Testing

- Currently supports two browsers:
    - Firefox
    - Chrome/Chromium
- Set the browser flag

    ```sh
    quickstrom check --browser=chrome ...
    ```

## Trailing State Changes

- Default: record a single state change after each action
- Can be overriden to record *trailing* state changes
- Often caused by asynchronous operations
- Two command-line options:
    - `--max-trailing-state-changes`
    - `--trailing-state-change-timeout`

# Future Work

- Possible Features
    - Better error reporting
    - Coverage (for specifications)
    - Screenshotting unique states
    - Targeted search

- Commercial Product
    - Keep Quickstrom and the CLI open source
    - Build a SaaS on top
        - Browser-based IDE for specs and runner
        - Scheduled checks and reports
        - Integrations (CI, WebDriver services)
        - Alternative specification language (e.g. subset of JavaScript)
